Regression modeling and their comparisons.

@Author: Jonathan David Merran

This repository contains three jupyter notebooks, that explore two data sets, the cars data set and the insurance charges data set.
It also contains the requisite models package that provides functions for some of the analysis and data generation.

Here I demonstrate linear regression and two different kinds of decision tree regression modeling, evalulate their performance using various
data visualizations like validation curves.
