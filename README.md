Regression modeling and their comparisons.

@Author: Jonathan David Merran

This repository contains three jupyter notebooks, and their PDF printouts for those that don't have python or juptyer notebook installed,
that explore two data sets, the cars data set and the insurance charges data set. 

Here I demonstrate linear regression and two different kinds of decision tree regression modeling, evalulate their performance using various
data visualizations like validation curves.
